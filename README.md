# LetGo

LetGo is a lightweight Chrome extension that closes tabs you haven't viewed for a while.

## Install in Chrome (unpacked)

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select the folder that contains this `README.md` and `manifest.json` (the repo root).
5. The extension should appear in your extensions list.
6. To configure the idle timeout, open **Details** and click **Extension options** (or right-click the extension icon and choose **Options**).

## Configure the idle timeout

Use the options page to set how many minutes a tab can be idle before it closes. Pinned tabs and the currently active tab are never closed.
